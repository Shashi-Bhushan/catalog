        summary="&lt;p>&lt;b>Kevin Mitnick, the world's most famous hacker, teaches you easy cloaking and counter-measures for citizens and consumers in the age of Big Brother and Big Data.&lt;/b>&lt;br>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;br>&#xd;&#xa;Like it or not, your every move is being watched and analyzed. Consumer's identities are being stolen, and a person's every step is being tracked and stored. What once might have been dismissed as paranoia is now a hard truth, and privacy is a luxury few can afford or understand.&lt;br>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;br>&#xd;&#xa;In this explosive yet practical book, Kevin Mitnick illustrates what is happening without your knowledge--and he teaches you &amp;quot;the art of invisibility.&amp;quot; Mitnick is the world's most famous--and formerly the Most Wanted--computer hacker. He has hacked into some of the country's most powerful and seemingly impenetrable agencies and companies, and at one point he was on a three-year run from the FBI. Now, though, Mitnick is reformed and is widely regarded as&amp;nbsp;&lt;i>the&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i>expert on the subject of computer security. He knows exactly how vulnerabilities can be exploited and just what to do to prevent that from happening.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;br>&#xd;&#xa;In THE ART OF INVISIBILITY Mitnick provides both online and real life tactics and inexpensive methods to protect you and your family, in easy step-by-step instructions. He even talks about more advanced &amp;quot;elite&amp;quot; techniques, which, if used properly, can maximize your privacy. Invisibility isn't just for superheroes--privacy is a power you deserve and need in this modern age.&lt;br>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;"

        summary="&lt;p>&lt;b>In recent years, Google’s autonomous cars have logged thousands of miles on American highways and IBM’s Watson trounced the best human Jeopardy! players. Digital technologies—with hardware, software, and networks at their core—will in the near future diagnose diseases more accurately than doctors can, apply enormous data sets to transform retailing, and accomplish many tasks once considered uniquely human.&lt;/b>&lt;br>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;br>&#xd;&#xa;In The Second Machine Age MIT’s Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee—two thinkers at the forefront of their field—reveal the forces driving the reinvention of our lives and our economy. As the full impact of digital technologies is felt, we will realize immense bounty in the form of dazzling personal technology, advanced infrastructure, and near-boundless access to the cultural items that enrich our lives.&lt;/b>&lt;br>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;br>&#xd;&#xa;Amid this bounty will also be wrenching change. Professions of all kinds—from lawyers to truck drivers—will be forever upended. Companies will be forced to transform or die. Recent economic indicators reflect this shift: fewer people are working, and wages are falling even as productivity and profits soar.&lt;/b>&lt;br>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;br>&#xd;&#xa;Drawing on years of research and up-to-the-minute trends, Brynjolfsson and McAfee identify the best strategies for survival and offer a new path to prosperity. These include revamping education so that it prepares people for the next economy instead of the last one, designing new collaborations that pair brute processing power with human ingenuity, and embracing policies that make sense in a radically transformed landscape.&lt;/b>&lt;br>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;br>&#xd;&#xa;A fundamentally optimistic book, The Second Machine Age alters how we think about issues of technological, societal, and economic progress.&lt;br>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;"
