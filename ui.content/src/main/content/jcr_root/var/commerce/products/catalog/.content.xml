        summary="&lt;p>&lt;b>Kevin Mitnick, the world's most famous hacker, teaches you easy cloaking and counter-measures for citizens and consumers in the age of Big Brother and Big Data.&lt;/b>&lt;br>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;br>&#xd;&#xa;Like it or not, your every move is being watched and analyzed. Consumer's identities are being stolen, and a person's every step is being tracked and stored. What once might have been dismissed as paranoia is now a hard truth, and privacy is a luxury few can afford or understand.&lt;br>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;br>&#xd;&#xa;In this explosive yet practical book, Kevin Mitnick illustrates what is happening without your knowledge--and he teaches you &amp;quot;the art of invisibility.&amp;quot; Mitnick is the world's most famous--and formerly the Most Wanted--computer hacker. He has hacked into some of the country's most powerful and seemingly impenetrable agencies and companies, and at one point he was on a three-year run from the FBI. Now, though, Mitnick is reformed and is widely regarded as&amp;nbsp;&lt;i>the&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i>expert on the subject of computer security. He knows exactly how vulnerabilities can be exploited and just what to do to prevent that from happening.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;br>&#xd;&#xa;In THE ART OF INVISIBILITY Mitnick provides both online and real life tactics and inexpensive methods to protect you and your family, in easy step-by-step instructions. He even talks about more advanced &amp;quot;elite&amp;quot; techniques, which, if used properly, can maximize your privacy. Invisibility isn't just for superheroes--privacy is a power you deserve and need in this modern age.&lt;br>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;"
